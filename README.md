```

### GITPOD Configuration

### DBT Configuration

Fill the profile.yml file to provide the corresponding information :

* **DATABASE_NAME** : Snowflake Database created previously

## Exercice 1 - DBT Model

Giving the following class diagram, construct models representing *BRONZE_TABLE_ORDER* and *BRONZE_TABLE_PRICE*. You can take as an example the *BRONZE_TABLE_AGENT* and *BRONZE_TABLE_ORDER* models

You can run your model with

```bash
dbt run
```

or only one model with

```bash
dbt run --select BRONZE_TABLE_AGENT
```

## Exercice 2 - DBT Python

Modify the PYTHON_MODEL.py to add a new column representing the volume giving quantity and price
